npm modules
	load from app directory or npm module
	yui log filter

optimize dependency loading via nodejs:
	configure versions on the server
	call function that does Y.Loader.resolve() to return complete list of deps
		memoized, so the result is cached
	also provide function to generate loader config


animation + history manager when browsing
	attach event to Back link

upload
	if doesn't have -min.js, create it
		https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS
	if --company is configured, put copyright at top:  /* Copyright {year} {company} All rights reserved. */
	compute transitive dependencies when upload, to reduce number of requests
	-g => gallery module, so prepend sp- to name

	document protocol

	fix relative url's in css files

auth
	cli for creating/removing group
		normal user can only remove group to which he belongs
	cli for adding/removing user from a group
		normal user can only modify group to which he belongs

	cli for deleting namespace, bundle, ns module, version
		mark as deleted in info
		(not actually deleted, to avoid re-using name/version)

search
	support "keywords" in description file
	index description files when start up -- search by module name, keyword, short, long
	update index when new modules/bundles are uploaded

edit namespace/module/bundle descriptions & keywords

ui for stats:
	% of hits that caused re-add
	graph all keys: % of total hits vs log(size of response)
		for individual hour or range of hours
		zoom buttons:  10%, 25%, 50% (color inside square for in, color outside rect for out)
		scroll buttons:  5% (<), 25% (<<), all the way (|<)
