upload
	upload output of build: either a module (build/...) or bundle (the whole build directory or list of directories)

	args:
		namespace/module/version or bundle/version
		directory
		(optional) host url -- defaults to localhost:8080

	fix relative url's in css files

	default to `whoami`, override with -u
		if new user and mail-server is not set, ask for email
	initial request to check that module/bundle/version is not used and check authentication type
		if require password, ask for it and send as part of upload token request
	authenticate and get upload token
		if namespace or bundle doesn't exist, create and set owner to creator
	send one module at a time, since bundle could be huge
		if doesn't have -min.js, create it
		if --company is configured, put copyright at top:  /* Copyright {year} {company} All rights reserved. */
		compute transitive dependencies when upload, to reduce number of requests
	send finished

	upload token
		store last used, so if conversation not closed, toss after 1 hour
		cull when generate the next token
auth
	UnixAuth: when passwords on machine are sufficient
	others, e.g., LDAPAuth

	manage list of users who can upload/edit each namespace or bundle
	config option:  --mail-server yahoo-inc.com
		if set, allow author to not include @...; automatically append @host

search
	support "keywords" in description file
	index description files when start up -- search by module name, keyword, short, long
	update index when new modules/bundles are uploaded

edit namespace/module/bundle descriptions & keywords

mark namespace, bundle, ns module, version as deleted -- not actually deleted, to avoid re-using name/version

ui for stats:
	% of hits that caused re-add
	graph all keys: % of total hits vs log(size of response)
		for individual hour or range of hours
		zoom buttons:  10%, 25%, 50% (color inside square for in, color outside rect for out)
		scroll buttons:  5% (<), 25% (<<), all the way (|<)
