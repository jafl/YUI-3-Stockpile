This package is deprecated.  Use https://github.com/yahoo/YUI-3-Stockpile instead.

YUI 3 combo handler built on NodeJS that supports versioning, either for
individual modules or for groups of modules.  (The name "stockpile" was
chosen because it's a synonym of gallery, but without the glamorous
connotation.)
